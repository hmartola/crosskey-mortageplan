# Crosskey codetest mortageplan

Start the application by navigating to the project's root folder and typing `mvnw spring-boot:run` . Make sure port 8080 is not already in use.

The URL address is localhost:8080/mortageplan

The application reads the text file contents and writes the calculated mortages to that same file, while the data typed via the web interface also writes to the file. 

The project was built with Java 8, Spring Boot and Thymeleaf for the web interface.
